# Getting Started with Teal (workshop) üéáü§©

This repository forms part of a introduction to development in [TEAL](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/) and [PYTEAL](https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) explained also in these [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10gSTn77q41u_AKdGSNYvbzWZigFDtO23uTr8vJYN94s/edit?usp=sharing).

**Resources:**
- [Simple Teal](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/smartsigs/walkthrough/?from_query=smart%20sig#simple-teal-example) (From Algorand).
- [AMM Repo](https://github.com/gpylypchuk/DeFi-AMM) (Mio).

# Teal üòµ
Below there are the steps to follow and test by yourself a smart signature.

## 1. Instalation
Before start, you need to have instaled [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (only if you are in Windows), Docker ([Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)) and the Sandbox.

In a folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox
git clone https://github.com/gpylypchuk/workshop-intro-teal
```

### Start the Sandbox
This command will init the containers.
```bash
./sandbox/sandbox up
```

## 2. Copy the contract to the Sandbox
Posisionated inside the multisig sample folder:
```bash
../sandbox/sandbox copyTo simple.teal
```

Now you have copied the contract. To interact with it in the development environment you have to start the Algorand Develoment console.
```bash
../sandbox/sandbox enter algod
```

## 3. Compile it ü§Ø
When you're inside Algorand Develomnet environment, the next step is compile it. Here it comes the delegated signature!
```bash
# The '-o' indicates output
# The '-a' indicates address
# The '-d' indicates directory
goal clerk compile simple.teal -o mydelegatedsig.lsig -s -a YOUR_DELEGATED_ADDRESS -d .
```

## 4. Send a transaction
Now, you have compiled the code. The next step is test it üßê
Send a transaction from your delegated address.
```bash
# The '-f' indicates from (sender)
# The '-a' indicates amount in microalgos
# The '-t' indicates to (receiver)
# The '-L' indicates load
goal clerk send -f YOUR_DELEGATED_ADDRESS -a 100000 -t ANOTHER_ADDRESS -L mydelegatedsig.lsig -d .
```

## Congratulations üéâ
You have sent a transaction by another delegated address!
